# shoppy

## A Marketplace native app.

This project was built from a flutter course by Maximilian Schwarzmuller titled Flutter and Dart - [The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps).

It is a shopping app where users can register, login, add new products, edit and delete only their own products, add any product of their choice to cart and place their order. 

Though it is still under development but could come out as a full functional commercial app. You can fork the repo and learn or add new features to it.
